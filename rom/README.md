Starting from $2000, the ROM is mapped into the CPU's address space and is overlaid only by RAM according to the table.



## EPROMs / EEPROMs

The DOS Kernals are provided in an EPROM (e.g., 27C040/29F040 with 512 KB). This EPROM is divided into 8x 64 KB banks. During operation, all original ROMs in the 1541 must be removed or deactivated to avoid address conflicts.](mailto:retro@emden.net)
