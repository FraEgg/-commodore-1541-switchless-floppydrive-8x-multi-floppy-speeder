# Switchless Floppy Drive 8x Multi Floppy Speeder for the Commodore 1541 floppy disk drive (V2.2c)



## ATF16V8 PLD

ATF16V8 is a high-performance CMOS Electrically-Erasable Programmable Logic Device. This component controls the address logic of the EPROM and RAM for the 8x Multi-Speeder. I use ATF16V8B(QL) types in DIP (THT) or SOIC (SMD) form factors.



The firmware file `ATF16V8_Logic_Vx_xx.jed` can be downloaded from [/logic/](https://github.com/FraEgg/commodore-1541-switchless-floppydrive-8x-multi-floppy-speeder/tree/master/logic).
